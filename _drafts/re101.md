## Solution

### Question 1

File: MALWARE000 - I've used this new encryption I heard about online for my warez; I bet you can't extract the flag

**0ops_i_used_1337_b64_encryption**

```bash
strings malware000 | less
```

```bash
$ echo "ZmxhZzwwb3BzX2lfdXNlZF8xMzM3X2I2NF9lbmNyeXB0aW9uPgo=" | base64 -d
flag<0ops_i_used_1337_b64_encryption>
```

### Question 2

File: Just some JS - Check out what I can do

**what_a_cheeky_language!1!**
By googline javascript obfuscation, we are able to find out that the javascript is in jsfuck language. We can use dcode.fr to decode the javascript.

<https://www.dcode.fr/jsfuck-language>
```console.log("flag<what_a_cheeky_language!1!>")```

### Question 3

File: This is not JS - I'm tired of Javascript. Luckily, I found the grand-daddy of that lame last language!

**Now_THIS_is_programming**
This is yet another obfuscated language called brainfuck. We can use dcode.fr again to decode the language.
<https://www.dcode.fr/brainfuck-language>
```flag<Now_THIS_is_programming>```

### Question 4

File: Unzip Me - I zipped flag.txt and encrypted it with the password "password", but I think the header got messed up... You can have the flag if you fix the file

**R3ad_th3_spec**
By looking up the header of the zip file structure according to <https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html>, we can see that the hex values at offset 1A is 58 58.

Using VSCode, we will need to edit the hex header of the corrupted zip file to 0800 at offset 1A as below. Afterwards we will be able to extract the flag.txt file to get the flag.

flag<R3ad_th3_spec>

### Quesiton 5

File: MALWARE101 - Apparently, my encryption isn't so secure. I've got a new way of hiding my flags!

### Question 6

File: MALWARE201 - Ugh... I guess I'll just roll my own encryption. I'm not too good at math, but it looks good to me!
