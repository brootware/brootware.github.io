## Category

OSINT - Open Source Intelligence

## Challenge Details

You have been tasked by a client whose network was compromised and brought offline to investigate the incident and determine the attacker's identity.

Incident responders and digital forensic investigators are currently on the scene and have conducted a preliminary investigation. Their findings show that the attack originated from a single user account, probably, an insider.

Investigate the incident, find the insider, and uncover the attack actions.

## Solution

### 1

File -> Github.txt: What is the API key the insider added to his GitHub repositories?

```bash
cat Github.txt                           
https://github.com/EMarseille99   
```

By enumerating further on a javascript custom [login page project](https://github.com/EMarseille99/Project-Build---Custom-Login-Page/blob/master/Login%20Page.js) that this github user is working on, we can find the API Key within the code.

```javascript
API Key = aJFRaLHjMXvYZgLPwiJkroYLGRkNBW

API_KEY=aJFRaLHjMXvYZgLPwiJkroYLGRkNBW

### 2

File -> Github.txt: What is the plaintext password the insider added to his GitHub repositories?

```javascript
<!-- 
This .jsp calls the "UserProfile" servlet at the point in which the user 
input's their username and password into the form's text fields
-->

<form class="login100-form validate-form" action="UserProfile" method="post">

<div class="wrap-input100 validate-input" data-validate = "Valid username is required: FileCubeUser100">

    Username: EMarseille99
    
    <span class="focus-input100"></span>
    <span class="symbol-input100">
    <i class="fa fa-chain" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </span>
    
</div> 


<div class="wrap-input100 validate-input" data-validate = "Password is required">

    Password: UGljYXNzb0JhZ3VldHRlOTk=
    Password(base64)
    
    <span class="focus-input100"></span>
    <span class="symbol-input100">
    <i class="fa fa-lock" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </span>
</div>

<div>
    <input class="login100-form-btn" type="submit" value="Login">
</div>

</form>

</body>
```

From the same javascript [login page project](https://github.com/EMarseille99/Project-Build---Custom-Login-Page/blob/master/Login%20Page.js), we can find the password that is encode in base64. We can simply decode as follow and get the flag.

```bash
echo 'UGljYXNzb0JhZ3VldHRlOTk=' | base64 --decode
PicassoBaguette99
```
