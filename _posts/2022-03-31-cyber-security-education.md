# What is this?

Cyber Security University is a curated list of free educational resources that focuses on learn by doing.

There are 6 parts to this. Introduction and Pre-security, Free Beginner Red Team Path, Free Beginner Blue Team Path, Bonus practices/latest CVEs and Extremely Hard rooms to do. The tasks are linear in nature of difficulty. So it's recommended to do in order. But you can still jump around and skip some rooms If you find that you are already familiar with the concepts.

(I will be adding more blue team contents in as and when I am free. So do keep an eye out for them.)

If you want to keep track of your progress, you can fork this repo on github and follow the instructions.

<https://github.com/brootware/Cyber-Security-University>

You will find the html code for below badges hidden in the repo.

<a href="https://github.com/brootware/Cyber-Security-University"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Blue%20Team%20Path-blue" /></a>

This blog post is mainly to keep track and be accountable for myself.
