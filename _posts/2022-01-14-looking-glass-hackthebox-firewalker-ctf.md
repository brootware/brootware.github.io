## Question

### We've built the most secure networking tool in the market, come and check it out

## Solution

This challenge is a remote code execution vulnerability challenge. You are given a web page to test out web-based networking tools namely ping and traceroute.
The web page is quickly popped in Owasp ZAP to recon the requests and responses to and from the server.

A breakpoint is set to examine the request further.

From the request, we can see that a ping request is sent to the server in the following format.
`test=ping&ip_address=188.166.174.107&submit=Test`

A test injection command is crafted in the command as below to see if the request would be vulnerable to remote code execution on the server.

`test=ping&ip_address=188.166.174.107;id&submit=Test`

Indeed, the web application is vulnerable to an RCE from the response.

Another test command is crafted to further enumerate the context of the environment we're in as below.
`test=ping&ip_address=188.166.174.107;pwd&submit=Test`
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brootware/CTF-Writeups/master/Web-Exploitation/lookingGlass/4.png)

The command again shows that we are in the www directory of the server.

We can see from here that there is a flag file one level up from the www directory of the server.

The final command is crafted further to read the contents of the flag file.
`test=ping&ip_address=188.166.174.107;cd ..;cat flag_Hy10K&submit=Test`
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brootware/CTF-Writeups/master/Web-Exploitation/lookingGlass/7.png)

The output of the contents is then shown in the output pane of the looking glass web application.
